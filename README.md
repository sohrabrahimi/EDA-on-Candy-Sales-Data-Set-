# EDA-on-Candy-Sales-Data-Set-
Udacity Project 4: 

In this project I will explore a candy sale data set. This data includes infomation about the candy sale for 1253 markets in four major cities (i.e. Philadelphia, Boston, DC and Pittsburgh) for 31 types of chocolate. The geographic information about the markets are also included. 

I will try to answer the following questions in this project: 

1- Which Brands sell more and in which cities? 
2- Which zipcodes consume more candy on average? 
3- which markets sell more candies and what kinds of candies? 
4- Which candies are more likely to be sold together?
5- How different markets compare together interms of their candy sales? 
6- What parts of the city consume more chocolate? how different neighborhoods compare in terms of their chocolate consumption?
